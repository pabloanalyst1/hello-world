# Overview
This code written down in Python prints the "Hello World" message to the console, verifying that the code runs successfully in my local environment and can be published on GitHub.

This code shows not a simply code structure using: print "hello world", it goes beyond that in case the file is exported preventing it from running when not desired.

The purpose of the creation for this code is to make sure all the tools such as VS Code, Git and GitHub are properly set up for upcoming projects.
